# eventsourcingdb

The official PHP client SDK for [EventSourcingDB](https://www.eventsourcingdb.io) â€“ a purpose-built database for event sourcing.

EventSourcingDB enables you to build and operate event-driven applications with native support for writing, reading, and observing events. This client SDK provides convenient access to its capabilities in PHP.

For more information on EventSourcingDB, see its [official documentation](https://docs.eventsourcingdb.io/).

This client SDK includes support for [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to spin up EventSourcingDB instances in integration tests. For details, see [Using Testcontainers](#using-testcontainers).

## Getting Started

Install the client SDK:

```shell
composer require thenativeweb/eventsourcingdb
```

Import the `Client` class and create an instance by providing the URL of your EventSourcingDB instance and the API token to use:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Thenativeweb\Eventsourcingdb\Client;

$client = new Client('http://localhost:3000', 'secret');
```

Then call the `ping` function to check whether the instance is reachable. If it is not, the function will throw an error:

```php
$client->ping();
```

*Note that `ping` does not require authentication, so the call may succeed even if the API token is invalid.*

If you want to verify the API token, call `verifyApiToken`. If the token is invalid, the function will throw an error:

```php
$client->verifyApiToken();
```

### Using Testcontainers

Import the `Container` class, call the `start` function to run a test container, get a client, run your test code, and finally call the `stop` function to stop the test container:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Thenativeweb\Eventsourcingdb\Container;

$container = new Container();
$container->start();

$client = $container->getClient();

// ...

$container->stop();
```

To check if the test container is running, call the `isRunning` function:

```php
$isRunning = $container->isRunning();
```

#### Configuring the Container Instance

By default, `Container` uses the `latest` tag of the official EventSourcingDB Docker image. To change that, call the `withImageTag` function:

```php
$container = new Container()
  ->withImageTag("1.0.0");
```

Similarly, you can configure the port to use and the API token. Call the `withPort` or the `withApiToken` function respectively:

```php
$container = new Container()
  ->withPort(4000)
  ->withApiToken("secret");
```

#### Configuring the Client Manually

In case you need to set up the client yourself, use the following functions to get details on the container:

- `getHost()` returns the host name
- `getMappedPort()` returns the port
- `getBaseUrl()` returns the full URL of the container
- `getApiToken()` returns the API token
